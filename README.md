# PythonNotebooks
My Python Jupyter Notebooks, dealing with data science codes, EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering etc.

Welcome to this Repository, this repository contains the following files:

- MyNotebook.ipynb: This notebook contains a basic introduction to treating null values and outlier detection in a live dataset
  you will find that each cell is heavily commented and I've tried to explain every step that we're doing as we're doing it.
  
- Plots.ipynb: This contains an introduction to Visualization using matplotlib, for now I've added simple plots.
  In future additions I'll be adding more plots from Matplotlib with in detail functionalities of each plot.
  
 - BokehTest.ipynb: This file contains a basic overview of the plots and functionalities of the Python Visualization Library
   Bokeh, here I've tried to explain in simple terms how Bokeh works and how to plot simple graphs using Bokeh.
   Officiak Bokeh documentation can be found at: https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html
